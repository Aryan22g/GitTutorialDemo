This is first version of our app;
I want this to be commited

git status

git init

git add --a

git commit -m "Message write"

git log

rm -rf .git

git clone link (name you want to give)

create a file .gitignore
and add all those filename or foldersname you want to ignore


git diff
(compare staging area with working directory)

git diff --staged
(compare last commit with current staging area)

git commit -a -m "Direct commit message"
(commit tracked files)

git rm fiilename
(to delete a file)
git mv filename newfilename
(to rename a file )

git rm --cached filename
before moving a file to gitignore first make it untrack
